The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

On this webpage, I've used USGS data (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to create a visualization of an earthquake data set. Leaflet and Mapbox were utilized to generate a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the last 7 days with a magnitude of 1.0 and higher based on longitude and latitude.


Key Features:

  -The data markers are color coded and sized based on the magnitude of the earthquake

  -Clicking on a marker will generate a pop-up with additional information about the earthquake
 
  -A color-coded legend
  
  -Layer control with 2 different basemaps
  

Tools used:

  -GeoJSON file

  -Javascript

  -D3.js

  -JQuery

  -Leaflet
  
  -Mapbox
