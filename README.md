# leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

In this website, I've used USGS data (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to create a visualization of an earthquake data set. Leaflet was utilized to generate a map that plots all of the earthquakes from this data set based on longitude and latitude.

   * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

Tools used:
  -JSON file
  -Javascript
  -Leaflet
